            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I'm just a learner.<br>
                someone who wants to become an expert in Cybersecurity. I am developing a strong understanding on Linux and programming languages like C, C++, and Java. However, I am always looking to expand my knowledge further in the future.
                I'm specialising on Ethical Hacking, which I likes the most, and try to learn more in it.                
                And I'm also interested in Operating Systems, Cryptography and Networking.                
                To further develop my skills in cybersecurity, I plan to pursue additional training and certifications in areas such as penetration testing and network security.               
                I find value in the practical learning experiences offered by platforms like Hack The Box and TryHackMe, which have been instrumental in honing my skills in penetration testing and vulnerability assessment.</p>
